      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I'm a self-taught Software Engineer who ended up really loving to code! I enjoy learning new technologies and set aside time each week to continue to learn. I've mostly been using React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js. I've also been learning PostgreSQL. I have additional experience in customer service, marketing, and content-creation.</p>
